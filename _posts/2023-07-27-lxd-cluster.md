### [Managing the LXD snap](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/managing-the-lxd-snap/8178)

LXD clusters must all run the same LXD version. 

https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/snap-fix-channel/9725

snap switch lxd --channel=latest/stable

sudo snap refresh lxd


sudo snap install lxd --channel=latest/stable

snap refresh lxd --channel=latest/stable

To manually trigger a refresh on a cluster member and ensure that all cluster members are refreshing using the same phasing cohort, and thus get the same version, use:


sudo journalctl -u snap.lxd.daemon.service -f -n200

Production server:

* Use the latest/stable channel if you need the latest features and can specify a frequent refresh window.
* Use a snap refresh --hold lxd if you want to avoid the automatic release upgrade and have time to do manage the refresh cycle manually to ensure you get updates.
* Use an $LTS/stable channel if you donâ€™t need any of the features that were added since the last LTS release but still want bug fixes and security updates.
* Set a refresh window to match your system maintenance window.
