* Physicaly replace disks
* clone partitions and restore efi partition from DD img

### [Copy the partition table to the new disk](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/replacing-a-failed-mirror-disk-in-a-software-raid-array-mdadm/)

Copy the partition table `/dev/sda` to the new disk `/dev/sdb` (Caution: This sfdisk command will replace the entire partition table on the target disk with that of the source disk â€“ use an alternative command if you need to preserve other partition information):

```shell
$ sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdb
```

* Add RAID partitions back to md
* Update grub
