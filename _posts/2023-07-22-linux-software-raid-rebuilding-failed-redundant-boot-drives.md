### [Copy the partition table to the new disk](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/replacing-a-failed-mirror-disk-in-a-software-raid-array-mdadm/)

Copy the partition table `/dev/sda` to the new disk `/dev/sdb` (Caution: This sfdisk command will replace the entire partition table on the target disk with that of the source disk â€“ use an alternative command if you need to preserve other partition information):

```shell
$ sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdb
```


> However, when multiple arrays share the same drives [(different partitions of the same drive),](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/734715/multiple-mdadm-raid-rebuild-in-parallel) the rebuilds are delayed, since running in parallel here would not speed things up, but slow them down instead.

**resync=DELAYED** due to recovery `md124`
```shell
$ sudo cat /proc/mdstat
md124 : active raid1 sda6[0] sdb6[1]
      445996032 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U]
