### [Creating a Logical Volume by Specifying Size](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-lvm-to-manage-storage-devices-on-ubuntu-18-04#growing-the-size-of-a-logical-volume)

```shell
$ sudo lvcreate --type raid1  -L 200G -n lxd-lv ubuntu-vg
```


### [Growing the Size of a Logical Volume](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-lvm-to-manage-storage-devices-on-ubuntu-18-04#growing-the-size-of-a-logical-volume)
> To grow the size of an existing logical volume,  use the lvresize command. Use the -L flag to specify a new size. To automatically resize the filesystem being used on the logical volume, pass in the `--resizefs` flag.


```shell
$ sudo lvresize -L +100G --resizefs ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

Size of logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv changed from 100.00 GiB (25600 extents) to 200.00 GiB (51200 extents).
Cannot update volume group ubuntu-vg with duplicate PV devices.
```


 The logical volume and the filesystem of the `ubuntu-lv` **logical volume** on the `ubuntu-vg` **volume group** will both be increased by 100G.

> [The difference is that `lvextend`](http://www.microhowto.info/howto/increase_the_size_of_an_lvm_logical_volume.html) can only increase the size of a volume, whereas `lvresize` can increase or reduce it. If you accidentally reduce the size of a volume without first reducing the size of the filesystem contained within it then the filesystem is likely to be damaged irreparably.


### Extend the LV to the maximum size usable


```shell

# extend the LV to the maximum size usable
$ sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
```
